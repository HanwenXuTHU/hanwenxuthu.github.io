  Identifying proteins and genes with specific functions is crucial for biomedical research, yet current computational methods struggle to annotate novel functions absent from existing ontologies. We introduce ProTranslator, which reframes protein function prediction as a translation task—from textual function descriptions to protein sequences—enabling zero-shot annotation of unseen functions and paving the way for a protein "search engine" driven by free-text queries.
