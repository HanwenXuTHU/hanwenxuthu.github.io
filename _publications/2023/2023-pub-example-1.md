  BioTranslator introduces a multilingual translation framework that maps free-text biological concepts to non-text data, enabling scientists to interact with biological data without relying on predefined vocabularies. It allows the discovery of novel entities such as cell types and generalizes to tasks like protein function prediction and drug target identification.
