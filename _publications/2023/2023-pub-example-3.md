  Biomedical datasets often contain inconsistent labeling of identical concepts, making manual curation laborious. To address this, we propose the biomedical synonym prediction task and introduce GraphPrompt, a graph-based prompt-learning method that leverages the new OBO-syn dataset of 2 million curated pairs, achieving up to 37.2% improvement over prior approaches.
