  Large foundation models face barriers to clinical adoption due to cost, accessibility, and evaluation limits. LLaVA-Rad, a 7B open-source multimodal model trained on 697K chest X-ray image-text pairs, bridges these gapsâ€”achieving state-of-the-art factual accuracy with a lightweight, scalable, and clinically aligned design.
