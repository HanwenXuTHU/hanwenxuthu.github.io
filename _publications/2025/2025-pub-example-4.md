  Heart failure is a leading cause of death, and accurate donor–recipient heart size matching is vital for transplantation success. GigaHeart, trained on 180,897 CT scans, focuses on cardiac regions to achieve state-of-the-art performance across cardiac tasks. It improves heart mass prediction by 33% and reduces sizing errors by 57% compared to traditional equations, enabling more precise donor–recipient matching.
