  The key idea is to augment the sparse dataset by creating multiple views for each drug combination based on different modalities. We combined eight modalities of a drug to create 64 augmented views. By treating each augmented view as a separate instance, Pisces can process any number of drug modalities, circumventing the issue of missing modality.
